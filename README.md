This is a 24 hour Hackathon project that was built using React-Native, Google's Firebase,
Node.js, and Express.js.

In our society today, mental illnesses are still stigmatized and is a hard topic for people
to touch on. People with disabilities find it hard for them to fit into society, and thus
some don't seek for the help they need. Our application will help allow people to
be more open and feel more secure in this society where they feel alone and that they are not the only ones going through problems. We provide a safe and secure place for them
to share their worries and talk to others who have gone through similar experiences
with them.
