# accord

This is a 24 hour Hackathon project that was built using React-Native, Google's Firebase,
Node.js, and Express.js.

Social media is about connection. But when we go through tough times, the social networks we use don't provide a suitable environment to share and talk about struggles. When people only put their "highlight reel" online, there is a lack of the authenticity that we desperately crave in our weakest moments.  We believe that authenticity is cool, real, and emotionally healthy. It deserves a higher priority in our lives and should be built into the way we connect with others.

To address this issue, Accord is a mobile application that matches and connect humans experiencing similar life events.
